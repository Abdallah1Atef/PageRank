# PageRank
# PageRank Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the **PageRank algorithm**, a link analysis algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. The algorithm assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of "measuring" its relative importance within the set.

The project demonstrates how the PageRank algorithm works by simulating a small web graph and computing the rank of each node (web page) based on its incoming and outgoing links.

## Features
- **Graph Representation**: The web is represented as a directed graph, where nodes represent web pages and edges represent hyperlinks.
- **PageRank Calculation**: Implements the iterative PageRank algorithm to compute the rank of each node.
- **Damping Factor**: Incorporates the damping factor (`d`) to model the probability of a random surfer continuing to click on links.
- **Convergence Check**: The algorithm stops iterating once the PageRank values converge (i.e., the change between iterations is below a threshold).
- **Visualization**: Optionally visualizes the graph and the computed PageRank values.
